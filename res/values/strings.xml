    <string name="help"><b>What is this game?</b>\nThis game gives you ten randomly selected letters each round, 
        from which you must make the longest word you can. 
         Your score for the round will directly correspond to the number of letters in the word (1 point per letter).\n\nThe letter selection for each round consists of four vowels and six constonants - the frequency with which each letter appears corresponds to the frequency with which the letters appear in the English language.
